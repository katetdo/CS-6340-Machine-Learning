Good job with your first(?) dive into deep learning. I appreciate that you took the time to write down your sense of your own comfort with deep learning vs classical machine learning. In general, *everybody* has a harder time wrapping their heads around how/why deep learning models work, which is why people spend time trying to develop methods to explain why the models make the decisions they do. A couple items of feedback: 1) consider doing some sort of grid search over the different hyperparameters -- it can make it easier to track what models you built and why you built them and it would also be easier for me to see how deeply you dived into model optimization. Plus it would have enabled you to provide a more complete discussion of parameter effect on performance by e.g. plotting number of layers against accuracy; 2) You've got step_per_epoch set to 1 -- by doing this, you've actually forced to model to use a fraction of the data per epoch, which is why you've needed to run so many epochs to build up accuracy. I'd leave this at it's default value, number of samples in your dataset divided by the batch size. I took off a couple points b/c I couldn't get a sense about the effect of hyperparameters on performance except for #of epochs, but otherwise well done!
